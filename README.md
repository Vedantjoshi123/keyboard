# keyboard

This keyboard was created using HTML and CSS, and features a sleek and modern design with different colors for hover and active effects. 

The keyboard layout is similar to a standard QWERTY keyboard, with letter, number, and symbol keys arranged in rows.  Each key is created using an HTML button element, with CSS styling to give it its shape, size, and color. When the user hovers over a key, the background color changes to a red shade, indicating that it has been activated. When the user clicks on a key, it changes to an dark shade, indicating that it is currently active.  

The different colors and shadow effect used for the hover and active effects help to make the keyboard more visually engaging and user-friendly, as users can easily see which keys they have selected or are currently using. The use of HTML and CSS allows for flexibility and customization, making it easy to adjust the colors, layout, and functionality of the keyboard to suit different needs and preferences.  

Overall, this keyboard demonstrates the power of HTML and CSS in creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces, and shows how even simple elements like buttons and colors can be used to enhance the user experience.
